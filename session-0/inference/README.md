## Clopper-Pearson (frequentists approach)

Confidence interval for certain confidence levels, number of trials and number of success.
Requires `scipy` and `matplotlib`

```bash
python binomial_interval.py
```

## Bayesian approach

bayesian comparison of two options. For example: 10/10 vs. 48/50:
```bash
ostap best.py
```

Check prior influence:
```bash
ostap prior.py
```
## Rule of succession

Answering a question: "f we repeat an experiment that we know can result 
in a success or failure, **n** times independently, and get **s** successes, 
and **nâˆ’s** failures, then what is the probability that the next repetition 
will succeed?", Laplace proposed to use **(s+1)/(n+2)** ratio to compute 
probability.

This is equivalent to the solution of bayesian approach with uniform prior.
