# Statistical tests

## General

A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference used to make decisions whether 
the collected data support a particular hypothesis. Two paradigms are available on the market:
  * Frequentist inference is a type of statistical inference based in frequentist probability, 
     which treats “probability” in equivalent terms to “frequency” and draws conclusions 
     from sample-data by means of emphasizing the frequency or proportion of findings in the data. 
  * Bayesian inference based on the Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis 
     as more evidence or information becomes available.
