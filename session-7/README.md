# Statistical tests

## General

A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference used to make decisions whether 
the collected data support a particular hypothesis. Two paradigms are available on the market:
  * Frequentist inference is a type of statistical inference based in frequentist probability, 
     which treats “probability” in equivalent terms to “frequency” and draws conclusions 
     from sample-data by means of emphasizing the frequency or proportion of findings in the data. 
  * Bayesian inference based on the Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis 
     as more evidence or information becomes available. 

## Paired samples

A typical task of scientific researcher is to make inference about the question:
"Does a factor, which is infuencing of a cerain thing make a difference?"
To answer this question a measurement on a thing is done without and with the factor application.
These measurements frequently has a digital (or digital-like, for example yes-no) outcomes -- 
paired variables. Paired samples are samples to make inferences about the differences between 
two paired variables. 

An example, of such paired samples can be found in files: `WR2023-40yds.txt` and `RB2023-40yds.txt`.
These are results of 40-yard dash (a sprint covering 40 yards, 36.576 m), which athlets perform.
The question can be formulated as: "Does athlets tired after their 1st attempt?"
